# Cactus 2.0

Cactus 2.0 will be an improved version of the original project. It is currently in the early stages of development.

***NOTE:*** The original version of Cactus is now under [Cactus 1.0](https://github.com/3SUM/cactus/tree/master/cactus-1.0).

There are two modes to Cactus:

1. **Turbo**: Will attempt to change your summoner name to the requested one 24/7 until successful.
2. **Sniper**: Will attempt to change your summoner name to the requested one on the expiration date.
To see when a name expires check out [lolnames.gg](https://lolnames.gg/en/).

As of now *(24/05/2022)* Cactus 2.0 is in early development. No other public turbo/sniper tool is currently available as far as I can tell. If you wish to help with the development of Cactus 2.0 please contact me through Discord.

If you have questions or concerns please feel free to contact me here or on **Discord @icantcode#7527**.
